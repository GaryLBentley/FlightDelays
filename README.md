### Hypothesis:
There is a positive correlation between the size of an airport (International vs. Regional) and the likelihood that a departing flight would be delayed due to a delayed inbound aircraft. Specifically, it is hypothesized that International airports with higher volumes of air traffic will exhibit a higher probability of delayed departures due to late aircraft compared to smaller, Regional airports.

### Context:
Data analysis is warranted because the marketing departments at Regional airports would benefit by using this data in promotions to attract flyers. Regional airports service fewer travelers than their International counterparts, but they may be more attractive if they can boast that they offer a better flying experience due to fewer delayed flights. Not only are Regional airports usually easier for travelers to access, passengers spend less time getting to the gates, allowing for later arrival times and more convenience. An advertising campaign could effectively utilize this better on-time performance to their advantage.

### Data:
For this analysis, I will need to collect historical flight data from airports across the United States for a defined timespan. This data will need to include flight delay information for both arrivals and departures. I will also need to gather data that will allow me to identify which airports are considered International, and those that are Regional.
